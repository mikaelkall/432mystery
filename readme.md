# 432mystery

## Description

This is my solutions to the 432 mystery [ http://rjzdqt4z3z3xo73h.onion ]. 
This is a secret webpage that is hidden in the deepweb and only accessable
at the union network and by itś ipv6 address. If you are able to browse it
you will find something that has puzzled alot of people that have been there. 
It´s looks like a puzzle or a hidden messages. Spoiler alert if you want to solve 
it yourself you should stop reading here because here is my solutions to the problem. 
Will update after I unravel each mystery I find. 

## Prerequisite to access the page

1. Install Tor
2. Setup ipv6 tunnel if you dont have a native address [ http://he.net/ ]
   
### Access page

    nighter@devbox:~$ torify wget -ri http://rjzdqt4z3z3xo73h.onion

## Solutions

There is hidden png pictures hidden inside the wav files. Use the wav2png.py script to export them. 

    ./wav2png.py the_message.wav

The other two wav files I have no solution yet let me know if you solve it.  
Iḿ very sure a image is lurking inside these two files as well.

the_form.wav 
the_end_occurred.wav
